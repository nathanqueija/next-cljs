Minimal example showing how shadow-cljs could be used together with next.js to create static sites in CLJS.

`site` is a directory used by `next`, all `.js` files will be generated by shadow-cljs. I nested the `site` directory in the `shadow-cljs` project but you can also nest the `shadow-cljs` directory in the next root instead. I do not recommend mixing though.

## Run shadow-cljs

```
npm install
npm run watch
```

## Run next separately

```
cd site
npm install
npm run dev
```

## When done open in browser

```
open http://localhost:3000
```
